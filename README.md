## Travelling Salesman Problem
Given a set of cities and distances between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point. For example, consider the graph shown in the figure below. The shortest tour in the graph is 1-2-4-3-1. The cost of the tour is 10+25+30+15 which is 80.
The algorithm should take as input the number of cities, distance between all permutations of cities and give the shortest route as the output.
